## X.Org Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC)&nbsp; <img src="https://www.x.org/wiki/logo.png" width="120px">

- For the last several years, X.Org was a participating mentoring organization in Google's most excellent Summer of Code (GSoC) program. 
- That program provides approximately US$5000 to students to spend their summer developing code for an open source project.
- Rather than lose out on getting students working on X, the X.Org Foundation Board voted in 2008 to initiate a program known as the X.Org Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC) program.
