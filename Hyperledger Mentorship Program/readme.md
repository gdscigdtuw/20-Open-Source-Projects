- The Hyperledger mentorship program is aimed at creating a structured hands-on learning opportunity for new developers who may otherwise lack the opportunity to gain exposure to Hyperledger open source development and entry to the technical community. 
- It also provides a more defined path for Hyperledger to connect with the next generation of student developers to inject more talent into its development community. 
- Each mentee will apply and be matched with a mentor or mentors who are active developers in the Hyperledger community.
