## Kubernetes Release Team Shadows&nbsp; <img src="https://kubernetes.io/images/favicon.png" width="20px">

- The Release Team recruits a number of apprentices for each release role, in order to train new release team leads, handle tasks that each lead may not be able to cover, share knowledge about the release process, and help contributors broaden their areas of knowledge and participation. 
- These apprentices are called "Shadows" on the release team, and are equivalent to similar trainee positions on other teams, such as the Release Management Assistants.
- This deals with the new releases of Kubernates and roles can be chosen from role handbook given
- All details are available at https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/shadows.md
