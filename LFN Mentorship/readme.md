- The LF Networking (LFN) intern/mentorship program is aimed at creating a structured hands-on learning opportunity for new developers who may otherwise lack the opportunity to gain exposure to open source software development and entry to the LFN projects' technical communities.
-  Each mentee will apply and be matched with a mentor or mentors who are active developers and technologiests contributing to the industry's leading open source networking projects such as ONAP, OPNFV, OpenDaylight, FD.io.
-  Mentees will be eligible to receive a stipend. The total stipend amount will be calculated using a tiered structure based on the country where the mentee resides when participating in the program.
